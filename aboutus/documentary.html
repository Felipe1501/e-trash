                                Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, is made up of products that have no more value due to lack of use, replacement or breakage. The category includes “white goods” such as refrigerators,<b> washing machines and microwaves</b>, as well as electronic devices such as televisions, computers, cell phones, tablets, drones, as well as batteries, <b>cartridges and toners</b>. The destination of waste has become a global challenge. Brazil holds the title of seventh largest producer of electronic waste in the world, behind China, the United States, Japan, India, Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively.

                                Brazil is the leader in Latin America in the production of electronic waste, a position that no place would like to be. According to a study by the Global e-Waste Monitor carried out by the United Nations (UN), the country annually produces 1.5 tons of e-waste and only 3% is <b>properly collected</b> to be recycled or disposed of properly. The equipment has a chemical composition with substances that are highly toxic to the environment and its decomposition can cause great harm to human health. To avoid danger and protect nature, find out how to dispose or recycle products from major electronics brands such as Apple, Samsung, Motorola, LG, Sony, Acer, HP, Lenovo and Epson

                                In recent years, with increasingly rapid technological innovation and the popularization of electronics products, more and more people acquire new computers, televisions, cell phones and household appliances, generating a serious environmental problem: electronic waste or technological waste. These are thousands of tons of garbage that are produced daily in the Country, from the waste resulting from the disposal of electronic equipment. The growth of this waste multiplies at the accelerated pace of industrial production of electronics, which, every year, launches new and <b>sophisticated equipment in the consumer market</b>. E-waste when discarded incorrectly can pose serious risks to the environment and the health of the population. This is due to the use of heavy metals, highly toxic, in the composition of these equipments. Among such metals, the most common are mercury, beryllium and lead. In addition, there are several other chemical components that can be harmful to the environment. When electronic products are disposed of incorrectly, they end up being absorbed by the soil they came into contact with, also contaminating, later, the water table. Burning these residues is also not adequate, as it releases toxins extremely dangerous to human health in the atmosphere.

                                Electronic waste already represents 5% of all waste produced by humanity. While this number does not seem alarming, it represents around 50 million tons of garbage, thrown away annually. However, only 6.5 million were treated in an ideal way, according to a study by the United Nations University – UNU. The lack of proper disposal of this waste has created another problem: the traffic of electronic waste between countries. The existence of thousands of dumps, mainly in poorer countries like Ghana, Haiti, and even Brazil, which they accept the deposit of what they say is fertilizer, which is actually waste ash electronics. The problem lies in the difficulty in monitoring the flow of these residues. The crime organized has diversified and invested in this type of action, which is seductive due to the high profitability and low risk, due to the difficulty in monitoring this waste. In Brazil, the import of hazardous solid waste was prohibited with the advent of Law no. 12,305, 2010 – National Solid Waste Policy. However, it is known that the country still receives electronic waste from other parts of the world. The 1989 Basel Convention is the only international regulation to respect of electronic waste. Created by government representatives, NGOs and industry from around 120 countries, including Brazil, its proposal is to prohibit the movement of waste dangers across the borders of participating countries. However, despite being a signatory of the aforementioned Convention, Brazil still needs of adequate legislation for the correct disposal of electronic waste and combating illegal traffic of this waste. Most manufacturers, importers and traders lose control of their products after they are purchased by consumers. Later, the same equipment, already in a state of scrap, become environmental threats. In turn, the Government is exempt from liability and does not oversee the correct disposal of these wastes, turning a blind eye to the deposit of electronic waste by other countries in our territory. The situation is alarming and urgently needs to be tackled with a policy that determines mandatory rules and procedures, under

                                Scheduled obsolescence, also called planned obsolescence, is a technique used by manufacturers to force the purchase of new products, even if the ones you already have are in perfect working condition. It consists of manufacturing items that already have the duration of their useful life previously established.

                                This concept emerged between 1929 and 1930, against the backdrop of the Great Depression, and had the objective of encouraging a market model based on mass production and consumption, in order to recover the economies of countries in that period. Something similar happens nowadays, when credit is facilitated and governments encourage consumption. An emblematic case of this practice was the formation of the Phoebus Cartel, which, headquartered in Geneva, had the participation of the main lamp manufacturers in Europe and the United States and proposed a reduction in costs and life expectancy of 2.5 thousand lamps. hours to a thousand hours. Planned obsolescence is directly related to the increase in the amount of electronic waste generated and incorrectly disposed of, which harms both the environment and human health.

                                Electrical and electronic equipment have several toxic components in their structures. If disposed of incorrectly, these toxic wastes can contaminate the soil and groundwater, putting public health at risk. According to the Mineral Technology Center (CETEM), around 70% of the heavy metals found in controlled dumps and landfills come from incorrectly disposed electronic equipment.

These are elements that, from their extraction to the end of the product's useful life, cause potential damage to the environment and human health.

                                With the popularization of mobile telephony and personal personnel, the generation of electronic waste has increased a lot, as buying a new device is often simpler than repairing it, in addition to encouraging programmed obsolescence, practiced by manufacturers to encourage consumers to Always exchange your devices for new ones, usually once a year (or at a shorter interval). Some elements contained in electronic waste, although biodegradable, can remain in the soil for centuries, contaminating everything in the meantime. Noble materials such as gold, silver, copper and platinum, as well as rare metals, are difficult to obtain in nature. It is always preferable for the user to discard the correct devices.

                                In general, the main damage caused by electronic waste to the environment can be divided into three major groups. Are they: <br>
                                Reduction in the useful life of landfills <br>        
                                Electronic equipment such as computers and cell phones contain large amounts of materials that take a long time to decompose naturally, such as glass and plastic. When discarded in landfills, these materials increase the volume of waste on site and reduce their useful life, causing even more environmental impact.

                                <b>Heavy metal contamination</b> <br> Boards and other electronic equipment circuits contain significant amounts of heavy metals — especially mercury, lead and cadmium. This is one of the main environmental damages caused by electronic waste to the environment, as they are highly polluting substances that affect both the quality of soil and water, rivers and groundwater. <br>
                                <b>Harm to public health</b> <br>
                                Although it is not an environmental consequence per se, this problem is directly related to the incorrect disposal of electronic waste as the pollution caused by incorrect disposal can damage the health of the population living around landfills or who live from the separation of destined waste to them.

                            <h2 class="text-center">How important is correct disposal?</h2>

                                To avoid damage caused by electronic waste, there is no other way than to invest in the correct disposal and recycling programs that take into account all people and institutions involved in the useful life of the equipment. <br>
                                At the governmental level, an important step was taken with the installation of the National Solid Waste Policy and the Computer Reconditioning and Recycling Centers (CRCs), implemented by the Federal Government. But these initiatives are not enough. It is necessary that tax incentives be given to companies that carry out the correct disposal and avoid damage caused by electronic waste to the environment, since this is a costly process, especially because many companies that supply this equipment do not yet have logistics programs Really functional reverse. <br>
                                In addition, disposal stations should be more accessible to the population as a whole, since today there are few places where the correct disposal of electronic waste can be done.
