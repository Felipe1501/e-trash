            <p class="textoInicial"> E-waste (electronic waste), also called technological waste, made up of cells, batteries, computers, cellphones, radios, and many others, is an increasing problem in  Brazil. According to a study carried out by the UNEP, among emerging countries, the country produces the largest volume of electronic waste per person each year, which is equivalent to 0.5 kg. </p>

In 2014, the world collectively tossed an estimated 44.4 million metric tons of unwanted “e-waste” — battery-powered or plug-tethered devices such as laptops, smartphones and televisions. By 2030, that number is projected to grow to about 74.7 million tons, according to the Global E-Waste Monitor 2020.

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In addition, uninformed people discard their electronics in common garbage, which end up in landfills. As a result, soil, water and air are contaminated, causing damage to the nature and human health. To avoid this contamination, it is important that e-waste has a proper destination. <br> <br>
          &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; The PNRS determines that the country draw up plans to treat solid waste, establishing targets and recycling programs, and making industries responsible for the electronic products they produce. Electronic products and their components must be returned to the companies, which will provide the appropriate natureal destination. Approved in the Senate at the beginning of July and sanctioned by President Lula on August 2, 2010, the PNRS will address the obligation of consumers to share responsibility for the life cycle of products, having the duty to properly separate, store and dis pose, reduce generation solid waste and reduce material waste. <br> <br>              
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The electronics recycling market presents particularities such as the complex technology involved, costs, the destination of parts and materials when disassembled, the market that reuses them, among others. The equipment must be disassembled so that the constituent parts and materials are separated and destined for recycling according to their classification. However, there are parts of the electronic product that cannot be recycled and must be sent for natureally correct treatment. <br><br>        
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since 2008, in the State of São Paulo, people's access to electronic waste collection and recycling sites has become easier. In conjunction with the Sérgio Motta Institute, the Secretariat for the Nature created the “e-trash maps” project, which combines a database of collection points with the Google Maps platform. On the website, by entering the zip code and the type of electronic waste to be disposed of, it is possible to find the nearest places that receive and recycle this type of electronic waste.

        <p class="textinhos"> 
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sculptors, artists Joe Rush and Alex Wreckage, have dubbed it "Mount Recyclemore." Rush says he hopes the leaders spotted it on their flights to Cornwall and that it encourages them to address the world's avalanche of e-waste. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The message is we have to find a way of dealing with this electrical waste that we're producing, because we haven't got ways of repairing it and we haven't got ways of getting rid of it," Rush says. The world produces about 53 million tons of e-waste annually and that volume is expected to double by 2050, according to the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and the International Telecommunication Union. 
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adam Minter, author of Junkyard Planet: Travels in the Billion-Dollar Trash Trade says that most people in the developed world associate e-waste with unsafe practices in developing countries. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But he says Mount Recyclemore "forces viewers to consider e-waste as something that's local, immediate and very much theirs. Addressing questions of electronic refuse will in part require consumers in developed countries to tell manufacturers to make more durable and repairable devices. Artworks like this one are a starting point for the discussion."  <br> <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The sculpture, which took 12 people to build over six weeks, bears a remarkable likeness to the world leaders it depicts. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's famously unkempt hair includes a jumble of old telephone receivers hanging by their cords. Biden's skin is a carpet of green circuit boards and his lips are made of rows of the battered backs of Samsung and Apple smartphones. Joanie Willett, who teaches politics at the University of Exeter in Cornwall, says she thinks the most thought-provoking touch is the circuit boards that make up Biden's face. "Because these are things that we don't even see," she says. "It's totally invisible and we don't give any thought when we're using the stuff." <br><br> 
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sculpture provoked lots of comments about the nature among the scores of people who gathered there as dusk arrived Friday evening. There were also meta moments as people — with no apparent sense of irony — used their smartphones to shoot pictures of sculptures made with old smartphones. The installation is not only a striking piece of art and natureal activism, but it's also a smart piece of marketing. It was sponsored by musicMagpie, a British company that buys old electronics and refurbishes them for resale, and its U.S. brand, Decluttr. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Liam Howley, the company's chief marketing officer, says the company buys about 1,500 tech items and 40,000 media items — including old CDs and DVDs — each day in the United Kingdom — and its materials were used to create Mount Recyclemore. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "We're trying to raise awareness, make sure people know about it, can act on it and encourage better behavior to refurbish, recycle, reuse," Howley says. <br><br>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why dispose correctly? E-waste is composed of inorganic materials such as aluminum, copper, lead, mercury and other heavy metals, and is almost always wrapped in plastic. Because of this, the incorrect disposal of these materials causes several socio-natureal problems, since household collection does not deal with this type of waste and it ends up in landfills, contaminating the soil and water and causing public health problems. <br><br> 
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, electronic waste materials can be recycled, which implies a reduction in the use of energy resources, the release of carbon by industries and the use of water. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worldwide, only 20% of e-waste is disposed of correctly. In Brazil, this number drops to 3%. <br><br>

        <h2 class="tituloNews2"> Earth’s annual e-waste could grow to 75 million metric tons by 2030   </h2> <br>
        <p class="textinhos">
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Higher consumption rates of electronics, as well as shorter life cycles for many devices, are contributing to the rapid pileup. And most people also are not properly and safely recycling their devices, the report found. Of the 53.6 million tons of e-waste generated in 2019, only 9.3 million tons, or 17.4 percent, were recycled. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The yearly amount of e-waste is projected to almost double in weight from 2014 (44.4 million metric tons) to 2030 (74.7 million tons). Actual data is shown in dark blue, and projected data is in light blue. These numbers are based on calculations of global consumption of electronics as well as on simulations that take into account both sales and product life spans. The projected e-waste for 2020 and other future years doesn’t include any economic consequences that might be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discarded electronics can contain hazardous materials — such as cadmium and mercury in laptops and smartphones, and refrigerant chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons — that can leach into the nature (SN: 8/7/19; SN: 5/22/19). E-waste is also a source of plastic waste (SN: 4/5/18). What’s more, not recycling e-waste can contribute to global warming, the report notes, because humans are mining and processing new materials rather than reusing existing materials. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E-waste also contains so many valuable recoverable metals, such as iron, copper and gold, that it essentially represents an “urban mine,” the report states. The value of the raw materials in 2019’s e-waste could be as much as $57 billion — only about $10 billion of which was recovered through recycling. <br><br>

        <h2 class="tituloNews2"> Soaring e-waste affects the health of millions of children, WHO warns   </h2> <br>
        <p class="textinhos">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “With mounting volumes of production and disposal, the world faces what one recent international forum described as a mounting “tsunami of e-waste”, putting lives and health at risk.” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "In the same way the world has rallied to protect the seas and their ecosystems from plastic and microplastic pollution, we need to rally to protect our most valuable resource –the health of our children – from the growing threat of e-waste.” <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As many as 12.9 million women are working in the informal waste sector, which potentially exposes them to toxic e-waste and puts them and their unborn children at risk. <br><br>          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Meanwhile more than 18 million children and adolescents, some as young as 5 years of age, are actively engaged in the informal industrial sector, of which waste processing is a sub-sector. Children are often engaged by parents or caregivers in e-waste recycling because their small hands are more dexterous than those of adults. Other children live, go to school and play near e-waste recycling centres where high levels of toxic chemicals, mostly lead and mercury, can damage their intellectual abilities  <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children exposed to e-waste are particularly vulnerable to the toxic chemicals they contain due to their smaller size, less developed organs and rapid rate of growth and development. They absorb more pollutants relative to their size and are less able to metabolize or eradicate toxic substances from their bodies. <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers, aiming to recover valuable materials such as copper and gold, are at risk of exposure to over 1,000 harmful substances, including lead, mercury, nickel, brominated flame retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For an expectant mother, exposure to toxic e-waste can affect the health and development of her unborn child for the rest of its life. Potential adverse health effects include negative birth outcomes, such as stillbirth and premature births, as well as low birth weight and length.  Exposure to lead from e-waste recycling activities has been associated with significantly reduced neonatal behavioural neurological assessment scores, increased rates of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioural problems, changes in child temperament, sensory integration difficulties, and reduced cognitive and language scores. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Other adverse child health impacts linked to e-waste include changes in lung function, respiratory and respiratory effects, DNA damage, impaired thyroid function and increased risk of some chronic diseases later in life, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. <br> <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“A child who eats just one chicken egg from Agbogbloshie, a waste site in Ghana, will absorb 220 times the European Food Safety Authority daily limit for intake of chlorinated dioxins,” said Marie-Noel Brune Drisse, the lead WHO author on the report. “Improper e-waste management is the cause.  This is a rising issue that many countries do not recognize yet as a health problem. If they do not act now, its impacts will have a devastating health effect on children and lay a heavy burden on the health sector in the years to come.”  <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E-waste volumes are surging globally. According to the Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP), they grew by 21% in the five years up to 2019, when 53.6 million metric tonnes of e-waste were generated.  For perspective, last year’s e-waste weighed as much as 350 cruise ships placed end to end to form a line 125km long. This growth is projected to continue as the use of computers, mobile phones and other electronics continues to expand, alongside their rapid obsolescence.  <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Only 17.4% of e-waste produced in 2019 reached formal management or recycling facilities, according to the most recent GESP estimates, the rest was illegally dumped, overwhelmingly in low- or middle-income countries, where it is recycled by informal workers. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Appropriate collection and recycling of e-waste is key to protect the nature and reduce climate emissions. In 2019, the GESP found that the 17.4% of e-waste that was collected and appropriately recycled prevented as much as 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents from being released into the nature. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children and Digital Dumpsites calls for effective and binding action by exporters, importers and governments to ensure natureally sound disposal of e-waste and the health and safety of workers, their families and communities; to monitor e-waste exposure and health outcomes; to facilitate better reuse of materials; and to encourage the manufacture of more durable electronic and electrical equipment. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It also calls on the health community to take action to reduce the adverse health effects from e-waste, by building health sector capacity to diagnose, monitor and prevent toxic exposure among children and women, raising awareness of the potential co-benefits of more responsible recycling, working with affected communities and advocating for better data and health research on the health risks faced by informal e-waste workers. <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Children and adolescents have the right to grow and learn in a healthy nature, and exposure to electrical and electronic waste and its many toxic components unquestionably impacts that right,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Department of Nature, Climate Change and Health, at the WHO. “The health sector can play a role by providing leadership and advocacy, conducting research, influencing policy-makers, engaging communities, and reaching out to other sectors to demand that health concerns be made central to e-waste policies.”  <br><br>
